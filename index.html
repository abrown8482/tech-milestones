                    <h2>1. apple </h2>
                        <h3>Macintosh</h3>
                                <p>The original Macintosh was the first mass-market personal computer that featured a graphical user interface, built-in screen and mouse.[2] (Although the Sinclair QL became available one month before the Macintosh family and thus was technically the first home computer with a graphical user interface, the QL never attained widespread commercial success.) Apple sold the Macintosh alongside its popular Apple II family of computers for almost ten years before they were discontinued in 1993.
                                Early Macintosh models were expensive,[3] hindering its competitiveness in a market dominated by the Commodore 64 for consumers, as well as the IBM Personal Computer and its accompanying clone market for businesses.[4] Although they were less expensive than the Xerox Alto and other computers with graphical user interfaces that predated the Mac. Macintosh systems found success in education and desktop publishing and kept Apple as the second-largest PC manufacturer for the next decade. In the early 1990s, Apple introduced the Macintosh LC II and Color Classic which were price-competitive with Wintel machines at the time. However, the introduction of Windows 3.1 and Intel's Pentium processor which beat the Motorola 68040 in most benchmarks gradually took market share from Apple, and by the end of 1994 Apple was relegated to third place as Compaq became the top PC manufacturer. Even after the transition to the superior PowerPC-based Power Macintosh line in the mid-1990s, the falling prices of commodity PC components, poor inventory management with the Macintosh Performa, and the release of Windows 95 saw the Macintosh user base decline.

                        <h3>2. Apple IIGS</h3>
                                <p>The Apple IIGS (styled as IIGS), the fifth and most powerful of the Apple II family, is a 16-bit personal computer produced by Apple Computer, Inc. While featuring the Macintosh look and feel, and resolution and color similar to the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST, it remains compatible with earlier Apple II models. The "GS" in the name stands for "Graphics and Sound," referring to its enhanced multimedia hardware, especially its state-of-the-art audio.[1]
                                The microcomputer is a radical departure from any previous Apple II, with its 16-bit 65C816 microprocessor, direct access to megabytes of random-access memory (RAM), and mouse. It was the first computer produced by Apple to use a color graphical user interface (color was introduced on the Macintosh II six months later) and Apple Desktop Bus (ADB) interface for keyboards, mice, and other input devices. It is the first personal computer to have a wavetable synthesis chip, using technology from Ensoniq.
                                The IIGS set forth a promising future and evolutionary advancement of the Apple II line, but Apple increasingly focused on the Macintosh platform. The IIGS clock speed was intentionally limited below the maximum for the 65C816 so the system would not outperform the Macintosh.[2] The IIGS outsold all other Apple products, including the Macintosh, during its first year in production.[citation needed] Apple ceased IIGS production in December 1992.

                        <h3>3. Iphone 1</h3>
                                <p>In 2005, Apple CEO Steve Jobs conceived an idea of using a touchscreen to interact with a computer in a way in which he could directly type onto the display, instead of requiring a stylus which was common on existing technology of the time. He decided that the device would require a triple layered capacitive multi-touch touch screen, a very new and advanced technology at the time. This helped out with removing the physical keyboard and mouse, the same as a tablet computer. Jobs recruited a group of Apple engineers to investigate the idea as a side project.[10] When Jobs reviewed the prototype and its user interface, he saw the potential in developing the concept into a mobile phone.[11] The whole effort was called Project Purple 2 and began in 2005.[12]   
                                Apple created the device during a secretive and unprecedented collaboration with Cingular Wireless, now AT&T Mobility. The development cost of the collaboration was estimated to have been $150 million[13] over a thirty-month period. Apple rejected the "design by committee" approach that had yielded the Motorola ROKR E1, a largely unsuccessful collaboration with Motorola. Instead, Cingular Wireless gave Apple the liberty to develop the iPhone's hardware and software in-house.[14][15]                                       
                                The original iPhone was introduced by Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007 in a keynote address at the Macworld Conference & Expo held in Moscone West in San Francisco, California.[16] In his address, Jobs said, "This is a day, that I have been looking forward to for two and a half years", and that "today, Apple is going to reinvent the phone."[17] Jobs introduced the iPhone as a combination of three devices: a "widescreen iPod with touch controls"; a "revolutionary mobile phone"; and a "breakthrough Internet communicator".[18]                                       
                                Six weeks prior to the iPhone's release, the plastic screen was replaced with glass, after Jobs was upset that the screen of the prototype he was carrying in his pocket had been scratched by his keys. The quick switch led to a bidding process for a manufacturing contractor that was won by Foxconn, which had just opened up a new wing of its Shenzhen factory complex specifically for this bid.

                        <h2>4. TOP500</h2>
                                <p>The TOP500 project ranks and details the 500 most powerful non-distributed computer systems in the world. The project was started in 1993 and publishes an updated list of the supercomputers twice a year. The first of these updates always coincides with the International Supercomputing Conference in June, and the second is presented at the ACM/IEEE Supercomputing Conference in November. The project aims to provide a reliable basis for tracking and detecting trends in high-performance computing and bases rankings on HPL,[1] a portable implementation of the high-performance LINPACK benchmark written in Fortran for distributed-memory computers.                                        China currently dominates the list with 229 supercomputers, leading the second place (United States) by a record margin of 121. Since June 2018, the American Summit is the world's most powerful supercomputer, reaching 143.5 petaFLOPS on the LINPACK benchmarks.
                                The TOP500 list is compiled by Jack Dongarra of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Erich Strohmaier and Horst Simon of the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), and until his death in 2014, Hans Meuer of the University of Mannheim, Germany.</p>
                        <h2>5. Jetpack</h2>
                                <p>If you’ve always dreamed of strapping a jet on your back and soaring high into the sky like a superhero or secret agent, listen up. Selfridges, a posh department store in London, is now selling a personal jet pack, or jet suit, that will let a handful of well-heeled customers live out their "Iron Man" fantasies.
                                The jet suit retails for a stratospheric £340,000, the Evening Standard reported. That's about $443,000 at the current exchange rate. Supplies are limited: Only nine of the custom-made suits are available for sale.Designed by English inventor Richard Browning and made by Gravity Industries, a Salisbury, England-based tech start-up he founded in 2017, the jet suit consists of five small kerosene-fueled turbine engines — two worn on each arm and one on the back. It produces more than 1,000 horsepower, according to Selfridges. It can be used for flights of up to four minutes, Reuters reported.
                                The suit, dubbed “Daedalus” after the artist in Greek mythology who built wings of feathers and wax, is said to be able to lift a person up to 12,000 feet in the air — though users may want to stay closer to the grow.                                          </p>
